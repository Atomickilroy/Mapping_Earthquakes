## Overview of Project

#### - *This project was to build an interactive layered map using Leaflet.js API and using a URL to populate the map with the most current data on earthquakes around the world. (last7days) The circles in the images are proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake and each will display an informational popup. To suit user preference the background can display three different styles and the user can add or drop any of the three data tabs for added interactivity.*

## Purpose

**The purpose of this project was to start learning tools that work hand and hand web visulatizations:**
    -Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
    -Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
    -Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
    -Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
    -Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
    -Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
    -Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
    -Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
    -Render maps on a local server.
